## Architecture
✅ Draw a diagram and upload it into the private repo to deploy a ML Model into production on any
public cloud, you might consider the following components:

## Collaboration
✅ On the private repo build the following workflow, notice you might use dummy code.*

## Automation
❓ Configure Sonar Cloud https://sonarcloud.io into the private repo and run some test to validate
anything on the next topic.**

## ML Model Deployment

✅ Expose any already trained machine learning model as an API, please keep working on the
same private repo.***

Solution available at:
 - API: http://ec2-35-153-192-47.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8505/docs
 - Frontend: http://ec2-35-153-192-47.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8504

Your API might meet the following requirements:
- ✅ Should be written in Python following OOP standards.
- ✅ Should contain inline documentation.
- ❌ You should be running some tests using Sonar Cloud.
- ✅ The API might be able to make an estimation one by one or in a batch.
- ✅ The code might contain a Docker compose file to run the project locally.
- ✅ You might be able to store each estimation in any database.

## Presentation (nice to have)
✅ Point out the key points of your process, main challenges, and findings on a presentation or
document. In case you did it, send it by email as well.


## Notes:
*You might like to use git graphical tools to check this point before.

**Try the free trial for private repos scan.

***You can use any of the following models or any other you already have (remember NOT to focus on
the training but on the deployment of the model as an API that receive an input and respond with the
model output)
